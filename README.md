## Key Concepts

### Low-Code Revolution

Astonish champions a low-code philosophy, enabling users of all technical backgrounds to create complex AI agents using simple YAML configuration files and integrating MCP servers. This approach breaks down barriers, making advanced AI agent creation accessible to developers and non-developers alike.

### AI-Powered Agent Creation

The Agents Creator feature represents a paradigm shift in how AI agents are designed and implemented. By leveraging AI to create AI, Astonish offers an unprecedented level of assistance and automation in the agent creation process.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support

Astonish leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to extend its capabilities. MCP allows for seamless integration of additional tools and resources, enhancing the power and flexibility of your AI agents.

### Embedded Tools

Astonish comes with several tools embedded out-of-the-box:

- `read_file`: Read the contents of files
- `write_file`: Write or modify file contents
- `shell_command`: Execute shell commands

These tools provide a solid foundation for creating versatile agents capable of interacting with the file system and executing system commands.

## Installation

You can install Astonish using pip or from source code.

### Install with pip (Recommended)

To install Astonish using pip, run the following command:

```
pip install astonish
```

### Install from source code

To install Astonish from source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/schardosin/astonish.git
   cd astonish
   ```

2. Build and install the package:

   ```
   make install
   ```

   This command will build the package as a wheel and install it.

3. For development purposes, you can install in editable mode:

   ```
   make installdev
   ```

## Usage

### Setup

To configure Astonish providers, use the `setup` command:

```
astonish setup
```

### Creating New Agents

One of the key features of Astonish is the ability to create new agents using an AI-powered agent creator:

```
astonish agents run agents_creator
```

This command starts an interactive session where the AI will guide you through the process of creating a new agent using YAML configuration. Once the process is complete, your new agent will be ready for use.

### Running Agents

To run an agentic workflow:

```
astonish agents run <task_name>
```

This works for both pre-defined agents and agents you've created using the `agents_creator`.

To view the flow of an agentic workflow:

```
astonish agents flow <task_name>
```

### Managing Tools

To list available tools (including MCP-enabled tools):

```
astonish tools list
```

To edit the MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration:

```
astonish tools edit
```

## Configuration

Astonish uses configuration files stored in the user's config directory:

- `config.ini`: General configuration
- `mcp_config.json`: MCP server configuration

These files are automatically created and managed by the application.

## Example YAML Configuration

Here's an example of an agent configuration in YAML that demonstrates tool usage:

```yaml
description: An agent that reads a file, extracts key information, and summarizes it for the user
nodes:
  - name: get_file_path
    type: input
    prompt: |
      Please enter the path to the file you want to analyze:
    output_model:
      file_path: str

  - name: read_file_content
    type: llm
    system: |
      You are a file reading assistant.
    prompt: |
      Read the contents of the file at path: {file_path}
    output_model:
      file_content: str
    tools: true
    tools_selection:
      - read_file

  - name: extract_key_info
    type: llm
    system: |
      You are an AI assistant specialized in extracting and summarizing key information from text.
    prompt: |
      Analyze the following file content and extract the core information:

      {file_content}

      Provide a concise summary of the key points.
    output_model:
      summary: str

  - name: present_summary
    type: llm
    system: |
      You are a helpful AI assistant presenting information to users.
    prompt: |
      Present the following summary to the user in a clear and engaging manner:

      {summary}
    output_model:
      final_response: str
    user_message:
      - final_response

flow:
  - from: START
    to: get_file_path
  - from: get_file_path
    to: read_file_content
  - from: read_file_content
    to: extract_key_info
  - from: extract_key_info
    to: present_summary
  - from: present_summary
    to: END
```

This agent demonstrates the following capabilities:

1. Gets a file path from the user
2. Uses the `read_file` tool to read the content of the specified file
3. Extracts and summarizes key information from the file content
4. Presents the summarized information to the user

The flow defines the sequence of operations, starting with user input for the file path, followed by file reading, information extraction, summary presentation, and ending the process.
