## Priority Notes

### High Priority (Quality of Life)
- `astonish use team/org` — context switching without re-login
- `astonish config set` — quick config changes from terminal
- `astonish memory search` — search memory without starting a chat

### Medium Priority (Team Management)
- Team CRUD commands — currently requires Studio
- Resource publish/fork — currently requires Studio
- `astonish login --token` — needed for CI/CD pipelines

### Lower Priority (Admin Operations)
- Backup/restore — can use standard PostgreSQL tools
- Data migration — edge case for new deployments
- Org delete — rare, high-risk operation
