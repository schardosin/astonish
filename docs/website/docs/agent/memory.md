# Memory

Astonish provides persistent memory that survives across sessions. The agent stores, searches, and retrieves knowledge automatically, building a growing context base over time.

## How Memory Works

Memory is curated knowledge the agent accumulates — distinct from session history (which is a conversation log). The agent can:

- **Save** facts, patterns, and solutions during conversations
- **Search** across all accessible memory tiers before responding
- **Retrieve** specific entries for detailed context

Before responding, the agent automatically retrieves relevant memories based on the current conversation. This happens transparently via the knowledge retrieval system.

## Memory Tools

The agent interacts with memory through three built-in tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_save` | Store a new memory with content and category |
| `memory_search` | Semantic search across stored memories |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve full context around a specific memory entry |

### Saving Memory

The agent saves memories when it learns something worth retaining:

```
User: "Our API uses camelCase for JSON fields and snake_case for database columns"
Agent: [memory_save category="conventions" content="API uses camelCase for JSON, snake_case for DB columns"]
```

### Searching Memory

```
Agent: [memory_search query="API naming conventions"]
→ Returns: "API uses camelCase for JSON, snake_case for DB columns" (score: 0.92)
```

## Hybrid Search

Memory search combines two methods for best results:

- **Vector similarity** — Semantic search via embeddings (finds conceptually related content)
- **Full-text search** — Keyword matching (finds exact terms and phrases)

Results from both methods are merged using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

### SQLite Backend

- Embeddings stored as BLOBs with cosine similarity computed in Go
- FTS5 virtual tables for BM25-ranked keyword search
- Zero configuration required — works out of the box

### PostgreSQL Backend

- pgvector for vector similarity search with IVFFlat indexes
- tsvector for full-text search
- Three-tier search (personal + team + org) with weighted RRF fusion

See [Three-Tier Memory](../platform/three-tier-memory.md) for details on how memory spans the org hierarchy.

## Managing Memory in Studio

Studio provides a visual interface for memory management:

- Browse all memory entries with search and filtering
- View memory content, tags, and metadata
- Publish personal memories to your team
- Promote team memories to org level (admin)
- Delete or edit memory entries

## Memory Configuration

```yaml
memory:
  embedding_model: text-embedding-3-small
  search_limit: 20              # results per tier before fusion
  weights:
    personal: 1.2
    team: 1.0
    org: 0.8
  auto_memorize: true           # extract key facts from sessions
```

## Best Practices

- Let the agent save memories organically during conversations
- Use categories for organization (the agent does this automatically)
- In team deployments, publish useful memories to your team via Studio so colleagues benefit
- The agent automatically searches memory before responding — no manual retrieval needed

See [Sessions](./sessions.md) for how session history differs from memory, and [Three-Tier Memory](../platform/three-tier-memory.md) for the full multi-tier system.
