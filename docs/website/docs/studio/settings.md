## Credentials

The credential store manages sensitive values (API keys, tokens, passwords) used by tools and integrations:

- Credentials are encrypted at rest using [envelope encryption](../security/)
- Add, edit, or remove credentials from this panel
- Reference credentials in flows and tool configs by name
