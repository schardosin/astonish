      Welcome to the Agentic Flow Creator! I'm here to help you design a new agentic flow.
      We are going to create the initial flow for your agentic flow, which you customize later.
      Please provide an overall description of the flow you want to create. What's the main goal and what should it do?

    output_model:
      overall_idea: str
    user_message:
      - "Thank you for sharing your idea! Let's now check which tools you have currently available."

  - name: fetch_available_tools
    type: llm
    tools: True
    tools_selection:
      - shell_command
    system: |
      You are a system assistant tasked with fetching the list of available tools.
    prompt: |
      Use the shell_command tool to run the following command:
      astonish tools list

      Parse the output and create a structured list of available tools with their descriptions.
    output_model:
      available_tools: list
    user_message:
      - "Available tools fetched successfully."

      You are an expert in designing agentic flows. Analyze the user's overall idea and create a base flow structure.
    prompt: |
      User's overall idea:
      {overall_idea}

      Available tools:
      {available_tools}

      Based on this idea and the available tools, please:
      1. Create a base flow structure with necessary nodes and their purposes.
      2. Identify which of the available tools might be required for this flow.
      3. Highlight any potential challenges or areas that need further clarification.
      4. If any required functionality is not available in the current tools, note it as a potential limitation.
      5. Remember that input from the user can be collected directly from the application, so you don't need to require a tool for that.

      Present this information in a clear, structured format.
      Export the base_flow if line breaks between the items using \n

      If the tools are not sufficient to implement the flow, please indicate that the user should provide the specific tools throug MCP servers to be able to create the agents.

      add the the message for the user, detailing the base flow, required tools, challenges, and limitations, in the response message
      Structure the message to the user as follows:

      I've created a base flow structure based on your idea. Here it is, along with required tools, potential challenges, and limitations:

      Base Flow:
      {base_flow}

      Required Tools:
      {required_tools}

      Potential Challenges:
      {challenges}

      Limitations:
      {limitations}

      For any item that has a list (eg.: ['item1','item2']), please break in multiple lines and put * before each item.
      Do not use tools for analysis, format, or any other tasks that can be done by the LLM itself.

      Do you have any feedback or changes you'd like to make? If you're satisfied, type 'CONTINUE'. Otherwise, provide your feedback:

      {base_flow}

      User feedback:
      {user_feedback}

      Available tools:
      {available_tools}

      Please refine the flow, addressing the user's feedback. If the user typed asked to continue, keep the current flow as is.
      Ensure that any changes still work within the constraints of the available tools.

    system: |
      You are an expert in creating agentic flow YAML files. Follow the provided example and rules strictly.
    prompt: |
      Refined flow:
      {refined_flow}

      Available tools:
      {available_tools}

      Generate a complete YAML file for this agentic flow, following this specific format and rules:

      Rules:
      1. Node types can only be 'input' or 'llm'.
      2. 'input' nodes have limited fields: name, type, prompt, and output_model.
      3. 'llm' nodes can have all fields: name, type, system, prompt, output_model, user_message, tools, and tools_selection.
      4. 'tools' field should be a boolean (True/False).
      5. 'tools_selection' should only be included if 'tools' is True.
      6. 'tools_selection' should only contain tools from the available_tools list and should only contain the tool name, not the description.
      7. 'user_message' should only be included if we need to display something to the user, and should only contain fields defined in the output_model.
      8. Ensure all node names are unique and descriptive.
      9. The flow must cover all possible paths through the nodes, including conditional branches.
      10. Conditions must be properly formatted as lambda functions.
      11. Only use tools that are available in the {available_tools} list.
      12. Ensure all variables used in prompts are defined in the output_model of a previous node.
      13. Be careful with the content of the user_message, as it should only contain the fields defined in the output_model of the node.
      14. When adding a variable to the user_message, we should ensure that we request in the prompt for the content to be displayed to be well-formatted.
      15. Pay attention to not provided duplicate content to the user, as it can cause confusion.
      16. Make sure all variables used in prompts are properly defined in the output_model of previous nodes.
      17. Make sure variables in a node prompot are defined in the output_model of previous nodes.
      18. Make sure the node use the required variables in the prompt

      Example YAML structure (note: variables in this example are prefixed with 'example_' to distinguish them from actual state variables):

      ```yaml
      nodes:
        - name: get_user_input
          type: input
          prompt: |
            Please enter your question or type 'exit' to quit:
          output_model:
            example_user_input: str

        - name: analyze_input
          type: llm
          system: |
            You are an AI assistant analyzing user input.
          prompt: |
            Analyze the following user input: {{example_user_input}}
            Determine if it's a question or an exit command.
          output_model:
            example_is_question: bool
            example_input_type: str

          type: llm
          system: |
            You are an AI assistant answering user questions.
          prompt: |
            User question: {{example_user_input}}
            Please provide a detailed answer to the user's question.
          output_model:

        - name: farewell
          type: llm
          system: |
            You are a polite AI assistant saying goodbye.
          prompt: |
            Generate a polite farewell message for the user.
          output_model:
            example_farewell_message: str
          user_message:
            - example_farewell_message

      flow:
        - from: START
          to: get_user_input
        - from: get_user_input
          to: analyze_input
        - from: analyze_input
          edges:
            - to: process_question
              condition: "lambda x: x['example_is_question']"
            - to: farewell
              condition: "lambda x: not x['example_is_question']"
        - from: process_question
          to: get_user_input
        - from: farewell
          to: END
      ```

      Now, generate the complete YAML for the agentic flow based on the refined flow structure we've discussed, following the example and rules provided. Make sure to include appropriate conditional flows, only use user_message when necessary, and ensure all variables used in prompts are properly defined in previous nodes' output_models.

      After generating the YAML, show the content to the user.

      Please refine the flow, addressing the user's feedback. If the user asked to continue, keep the current yaml flow as is.
      Ensure that any changes still work within the constraints of the available tools.
      Only change what is necessary to address the user's feedback, nothing else

      flow_yaml:
      {flow_yaml}

      Save the content of the flow_yaml to disk using write_file tool in the config directory.
      The file name should be at 'agents/new_flow.yaml' inside the config_dir.

      Use the shell_command tool to run the following command:
      astonish flow new_flow

      Analyze the output and determine if there are any errors or warnings. If there are issues, summarize them clearly.
      Format the content before displaying it to the user.

      Verify that all the requirements in the Refined flow were met and that the flow is valid.
