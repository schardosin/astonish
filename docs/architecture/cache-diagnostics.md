# Model Cache Diagnostics

Studio can record cache diagnostics for model calls without changing model-visible requests. The feature is available only in platform mode to users with the platform `superadmin` role.

## Request stability

The main agent exposes exactly three provider-visible declarations in stable order: `search_tools`, `describe_tools`, and `execute_tool`. Domain tools remain behind `execute_tool`; searching the catalog never injects declarations. The system instruction is frozen for a session. Non-memory per-turn context remains persisted user-role history, while native non-Code automatic memory is appended as a request-local suffix for the current invocation only. Code retains its combined persisted context. Tool schemas and JSON are canonicalized recursively before provider conversion.

The suffix is repeated on each provider call within an invocation, including tool follow-ups and retries, and is absent from later invocations unless freshly retrieved. Compaction does not govern this lifetime. Removing or moving a suffix can cause prefix divergence, including between tool rounds: reduced accumulated memory does not guarantee cache hits or measured cost savings.

Diagnostics are request-scoped. Enabling the browser-local Debug toggle adds a recorder through `context.Context`; it does not mutate the shared agent or alter the request sent to the model.

## Capture semantics

Each request records a chronological lifecycle. Astonish preparation stages cover request/session preparation, memory embedding, guidance/general/tool retrieval, prompt/context persistence, and compaction when those paths execute. Every stage records start time, duration, and success or a bounded, credential-redacted failure. Failed preparation is retained even when no provider call occurs.

Each provider round records:

- the ADK model request's canonical SHA-256 and ordered element hashes;
- the estimated reusable prefix in elements and bytes, plus the first divergent path;
- provider/model identity, streaming mode, response count, first-response latency, and total duration;
- normalized token usage and provider-reported cached-read token count when available;
- a bounded, sanitized representation of the canonical ADK request.

`captureLevel: canonical-adk` means the payload is captured immediately before the provider adapter receives it, including the current invocation's final automatic-memory suffix. The request-local memory wrapper surrounds the diagnostic wrapper so every captured round sees the augmented request. It must not be described as exact HTTP wire JSON. Provider SDKs may still transform the request. A cache hit is provider-confirmed only when normalized usage metadata reports cached-read tokens. ADK does not expose a provider-neutral cache-write token field, so diagnostics do not report cache writes; zero cached-read tokens must not be interpreted as proof that the provider performed no cache write. Prefix counts are Astonish estimates and are displayed separately.

## Secret and binary handling

Diagnostics never store transport headers. Before persistence, known credential values and values under sensitive field names are replaced with `[REDACTED]`. Large base64 and data-URL values are replaced by deterministic length/hash markers. Stored payload JSON is capped at 128 KiB; an oversized payload is replaced by a valid JSON truncation manifest containing its sanitized size and digest. Error strings pass through the same credential redactor.

## Persistence and access

Diagnostics are separate from ADK transcript events so they cannot affect future model history. Personal and team session stores retain the latest 100 diagnostic records per session, including both preparation stages and provider rounds, and session deletion cascades to diagnostics. Rows are associated by ADK invocation ID and model-call number; the UI never infers turns from message position.

`GET /api/studio/sessions/{id}/cache-diagnostics?invocationId=...` resolves the session through the authenticated request's tenant-scoped stores and requires platform-superadmin authorization. The cross-organization administrative endpoint under `/api/platform/admin/` additionally requires explicit scope identifiers. The Studio panel is available only to platform superadmins and shows a chronological Astonish-preparation versus provider-dispatch view, including explicit stage failures, sanitized payloads, truncation/elision notices, timing, usage, provider cache status, and the estimated stable prefix.
