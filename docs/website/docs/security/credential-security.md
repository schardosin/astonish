# Credential Security

Astonish provides a secure credential store that keeps API keys, tokens, and other secrets encrypted at rest and invisible to the LLM at runtime. A multi-layer redaction pipeline ensures that secrets never leak into model context, logs, or responses.

## Credential Store

Credentials are stored encrypted using [envelope encryption](./envelope-encryption.md) and scoped to either a user (personal) or a team:

| Scope | Visibility | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Personal | Only the owning user | Dev/testing API keys |
| Team | All team members | Shared production credentials |

### Credential Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `api_key` | Custom header + value for API authentication |
| `bearer` | Authorization: Bearer token |
| `basic` | HTTP Basic Auth (username + password) |
| `password` | Username + password for SSH, FTP, SMTP, databases |
| `oauth_client_credentials` | OAuth2 client credentials with automatic token refresh |
| `oauth_authorization_code` | User-authorized OAuth2 with refresh token |

## Output Redaction

Astonish applies multiple independent redaction layers to guarantee secrets never reach the LLM context:

| Layer | Stage | Mechanism |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Injection | Secrets are injected into tool call environments via placeholders, never into the prompt |
| 2 | Tool output filtering | Tool stdout/stderr is scanned; matching values are replaced with `[REDACTED]` |
| 3 | Context assembly | The context builder verifies no known secret values appear in assembled messages |
| 4 | Channel output | Outbound messages to channels (Telegram, Slack, etc.) are scanned against active credentials |
| 5 | Audit and logs | All logging pipelines strip secret values before writing |

Each layer operates independently. If one layer fails, the remaining layers still prevent exposure.

## How Secrets Reach Tools

When an agent invokes a tool that requires credentials:

1. The credential is resolved (personal-first, team fallback).
2. The encrypted ciphertext is decrypted in memory using the org's DEK.
3. The plaintext is injected as an **environment variable** into the sandbox container.
4. The tool reads the credential from its environment.
5. After execution, the environment is destroyed with the container.

At no point does the LLM see the credential value. The model only knows that a credential named (e.g.) `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available — never its contents.

## Managing Credentials

### In Studio

Studio provides a credential manager under **Settings → Credentials** where you can add, view metadata, test, and remove credentials through a visual interface.

### Via CLI

```bash
# Add a credential
astonish credential add

# List credentials (values are never displayed)
astonish credential list

# Show credential metadata
astonish credential show <name>

# Test a credential (validates it works)
astonish credential test <name>

# Remove a credential
astonish credential remove <name>

# Set or manage the master key
astonish credential master-key
```

Credential values are never echoed back in any command output. The `list` and `show` commands display names, types, scopes, and metadata only.
