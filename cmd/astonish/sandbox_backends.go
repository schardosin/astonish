// Sandbox backend link-time registrations.
//
// Each backend in pkg/sandbox/* self-registers with sandbox.NewBackend via
// an init() function. For that init to run, the package must be linked
// into the binary, which requires an import somewhere in the import graph.
//
// The incus backend is already imported transitively (pkg/sandbox/incus is
// used directly by many cmd/astonish files for client construction), so it
// doesn't need a blank import here.
//
// The k8s and mock backends are optional, used only when the deployment
// selects them via BackendFactoryConfig.Kind. Blank-importing them here
// makes the astonish CLI a "batteries-included" distribution: all built-in
// backends are available without changes to config or build tags.
//
// Binaries that want to exclude a backend (e.g., to avoid linking
// k8s.io/client-go) can fork this list. Out-of-tree backends follow the
// same pattern: import your package to trigger its init().
